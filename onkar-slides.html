# Outline

.pull-left[

Outline slides like this one are commonly found in the wild. If they incorporate links they can become a useful "table of contents" for a slide deck.  

Downside is they aren't very memorable. I would encourage a "roadmap" approach to your presentations, using interesting transition slides that let your audience know where you've been and where you're going next.

  + Solvent: The susbtance in which the solute dissolves is called the Solvent
  + Solution: The substance which is formed by dissolving a solute in a solvent is called Solution. 


---
## Chapter 9: Q&amp;A Contintued

* What is a saturated solution? Does a saturated solution always hold the same amount of solute? 

  + A saturated solution is a solution in which the solvent cannot dissolve any more solute at a given temperature. A solution may dissovle more solute if it heated.

* Water and excercise are as important as a balanced diet. Justify this statement. 

  + Water and exercise are as important as balanced diet because water helps digest food and absorb digested food. A balanced diet without water will lead to no absorbption of nutrients. 
  
  + without exercise a person becomes lazy or obesse, good nutrition without propoer excerise is of no use as health is absent. 
  
  + balanced diet + water + exercise  = good health

name: chapter-6
## Chapter 6: To sum up

* Food is broked down into simple substances by digestion. 

* Digestion starts in the mouth and ends in the small intestine. 

* The juices produced by the mouth, stomach, pancreas, livers and small intestine helps in digesting food. 

* Water is absorbed in the large intestine. 

* The undigested part of food is sent out through the anus. 

* Young children have milk teeth, while adults have permanent teeth. 

* Every tooth has three layers - **enamel, dentine and pulp.**

* We have four types of teetch - **incisors, canines, pre-molars and molars **

* Each type of tooth has a different shape and size according to its use. 

* We should take care of our teeth to avoid cavities, bad breadth and diseased gums. 

* We should follow good eating habits to be healthy.

## Picture Question Contd..
  - a. Lable the parts marked in the picture
  
    + A. Mouth
    + B. Oesophagus
    + C. Liver
    + D. Stomach
    + E. Pancreas
    + F. Small Intestines
    + G. Large Intestines
    + H. Anus
 
 
---
## Picture Question Contd..
.fade[
  - b. What happens in the parts marked A and D? 
    + In A i.e. Mouth. We use to swallow food from mouth, the process starts with the food entering the mouth, the saliva starts breaking down the carbodydrates, the tongue rolls the food and and we swalow it.
    + D i.e Stomach, when we eat food, it will stay for few hours. Stomach juices partly breakdwon protein. The partly digested food (chyme) moves to the small intestine. 
]

## Picture Question Contd..

.small[
  - c. What is the funciton of part B? 
  
    + B i.e. Oesophagus. Oesophagus is the food pipe. the food travles down it from the mouth to the stomach. 
  
  - d. What are produced by the parts marked C and E? 
  
    + C i.e. Lever produces the juice bile, which helps to digest fats. 
    + E i.e. Pancreas makes juices that digest carbodydrates, proteins and fats. 
  
  - e. What are the funcitons of the parts marked F and G? 
  
    + F i.e. Small Intestine: The juices from the liver and pancreas breakdown protein, carbohydrates and fats. The walls of the small intestine absorb the digested food. 
    + G i.e. Large Intestine: Water is absored here. The remaining wastes are sent out through the anus.
