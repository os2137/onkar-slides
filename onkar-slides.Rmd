# Chapter 9: Matter and Its States


---
# Choose the correct answer. 

* The space between molecules is smallest in____

  + Solid

* The process by which water become water vaport is called

  + Evaporation

* The process by which water vapour becomes water

  + Condensation

* Sublimation is the process by which
  + Solid turns into gas

* A substance that dissolves in another substance is called 

  + Solute
  

---
# Fill in the blanks

  + Matter is made of tiny particles called (molecules)

  + The space between molecules is the most in (gas)

  + (gas) have to be stored in closed containers

  + An exammple of a substance that undergoes sublimation is (camphor)

  + A solute and a solvent together form a (solution)

---
## What are the processes marked A, B, C, D and E ? 

  + A. Liquid to Solid (Freezing)
  
  + B. Gas to Liquid (Condensation)
  
  + C. Solid to Liquid (Melting)
  
  + D. Liquid to Gas (Evaporation)
  
  + E. Solid to Gas (Sublimation)

--- 

---
# Answer the folowing questions

* What is matter? Name the three states of matter and give examples of substances in each state

  + Matter is anything that takes up place and has weight
  + Theree states of matters are Solid, Liquid and Gas
  + Solid: Wood, Glass
  + Liquid: Water and Oil
  + Gas: Oxygen and Carobon Dioxide

* List two differences between solids, liquids and gases

  + Molecules in the solid are closely packed, they have definite shape and volume
  
  + The space between between the molecules is more in liuid than solid, liquid doesnt have definite shape but liquid has definite volume
  
  + The molecules in gas are far away and they have lot of space to move, gases have neighter definate shape or nor definite volume. 

---
## Q&A Continued
* What is sublimation? Explain the process with an example? 

  + The submitation is a process in which solid turns into gas directly without turning into liquid, when heated. e.g. camphor when it is kept in open or heated it directly turns into gas without turning into liquid. 





--- 
## Q&A Contintued

* Define the follwoing terms: solute, solvent, solutioon

  + Solute: The substance which is dissolved in the solvent is called solute. e.g. Sugar is a solutin in the solution made up of water and sugar. 
  + Solvent: The susbtance in which the solute dissolves is called the Solvent
  + Solution: The substance which is formed by dissolving a solute in a solvent is called Solution. 


--- 
## Q&A Contintued
* What is a saturated solution? Does a saturated solution always hold the same amount of solute? 

  + A saturated solution is a solution in which the solvent cannot dissolve any more solute at a given temperature. A solution may dissovle more solute if it heated.

## Chapter 5 Q&A continued

* Why do young children need more portein than adults? 

  + Our body needs protein to grow and repair injured parts. Growing children need more protein as they are growing while the adults are already grown ups. 

* Water and excercise are as important as a balanced diet. Justify this statement. 

  + Water and exercise are as important as balanced diet because water helps digest food and absorb digested food. A balanced diet without water will lead to no absorbption of nutrients. 
  
  + without exercise a person becomes lazy or obesse, good nutrition without propoer excerise is of no use as health is absent. 
  
  + balanced diet + water + exercise  = good health

## Chapter 6: Digestion and Our Teeth

## Chapter 6: To sum up

* Food is broked down into simple substances by digestion. 

* Digestion starts in the mouth and ends in the small intestine.

* Water is absorbed in the large intestine. 

* The undigested part of food is sent out through the anus. 

* Young children have milk teeth, while adults have permanent teeth. 

* Every tooth has three layers - **enamel, dentine and pulp.**

* We have four types of teetch - **incisors, canines, pre-molars and molars **

* Each type of tooth has a different shape and size according to its use. 

* We should take care of our teeth to avoid cavities, bad breadth and diseased gums.
